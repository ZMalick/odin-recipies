    <h1>Salmon in Fig Leaves</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>While this salmon dish evokes pure summer in California, 
        it’s easily done almost anywhere. The salmon is king salmon, 
        and its season is summer, which coincides perfectly with the 
        ripening of figs in all but the northernmost parts of the country. 
        There is nothing better than a good fig, but for this recipe, incorporate 
        the underused leaves, which make a perfect package for the fish, contributing 
        a kind of nutty flavor to it. —Mark Bittman</p>
